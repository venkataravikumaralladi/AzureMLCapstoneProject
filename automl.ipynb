    "In this capstone project I will showcase how we can use data science as a investigation tool, here we use classfication algorithm to distinguish between normal traffic (good connections) and intrusion or attacks traffic (bad connections). A connection is a sequence of TCP packets starting and ending at some well difined times, between which data flows to and from source IP address to a target IP address under some well defined protocol. We will create Intrusion Detection System (IDS)\n",
